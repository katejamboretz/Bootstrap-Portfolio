                <p> 
                    I was born in L.A. and grew up in Colorado and outdoorsy Boise, Idaho with my six siblings.
                    I moved to San Francisco to run competetively and study biology at University of San Francisco
                    and went on to complete my professional masters in biotechnology also at USF.
                    My science career includes a year graduate co-op at Amgen and three years at a cell therapy start up Nkarta
                    in South San Francisco. My studies included short-term bioinformatics projects at Distributed Bio and BSRI
                    using commandline, python, perl and R, as well as General Assembly courses. 
                    I hope to solidify my coding skills through UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Coding Boot Camp from January to July 2020.

                    I still am an active runner, competing with the first all-women club
                    in the United States, Impala Racing Team. My husband and I enjoy exploring 
                    trails and towns and surfing along Highway 1 on the weekends. We both love 
                    going to yoga and meditation retreats to take time to slow down and heal. 
                    We also like traveling to our national parks and visiting my family in Arizona and Idaho.
